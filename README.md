# OpenIntentSign

**OpenIntentSign (OIS)** is a trust-based validation model and open architecture for ensuring state integrity across decentralized, modular infrastructure systems.

It is not just a library, a relay system, or a pipeline component.  
**OpenIntentSign is a philosophy of infrastructure-level intent validation**, where each declared state is expected to reflect reality, and each participating component is accountable for that expectation.

## 🌍 What is OpenIntentSign?

OpenIntentSign is:

- A schema-driven trust and validation framework
- A modeling layer for distributed, relay-based system orchestration
- A core building block of the [CentralInfraCore](https://github.com/CentralInfraCore) project
- A brand, a method, and a community position

It answers one fundamental question:

> **"Can I trust that the declared state of this system actually matches the real world?"**

## 📦 Key Components

This repository represents the umbrella for the following:

- `openintentsign-core` – the core specification and trust model
- `relay-schemas` – schema bundles for state validation and propagation
- `ois-agent` – local enforcement / reporting agent (planned)
- `examples` – real-world OIS use cases (CI/CD, monitoring, config validation)

## 🧭 Status

OpenIntentSign is an evolving public concept and open trust model authored by  
**Sinkó Gábor Zoltán**.

You are welcome to:
- explore the ideas
- build compatible systems
- contribute schemas or refinements

This is **not** a product – it's a **position**:  
An infrastructure should **prove itself valid** – or it’s not trustworthy.
